Thanks for visiting my blog.

My name is Raghuram Devarakonda and I am currently working as Software
Engineer with a firm in NJ. In all, I have more than 15 years
of experience in building software and over that period, I have
accumulated few personal preferences on the way things are done in
writing code. I am primarily going to blog about those preferences and
can only hope that some one some where finds them useful. Please feel
free to contact me at “draghuram at gmail dot com”.

way should they presumed to be endorsed by my current employer.*
