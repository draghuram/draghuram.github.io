Thanks for visiting my blog.

My name is Raghuram Devarakonda and I am currently working as Software
Engineer at [Catalogic Software](https://catalogicsoftware.com/). In
all, I have more than 15 years of experience in building software and
over that period, I have accumulated few personal preferences on the
way things are done in writing code. I am primarily going to blog
about those preferences and can only hope that some one some where
finds them useful. Please feel free to contact me at “draghuram at
gmail dot com”.

way should they presumed to be endorsed by my current employer.*
