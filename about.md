Thanks for visiting my blog.

My name is Raghuram Devarakonda and I am currently working as Software
Engineer at [Catalogic Software](https://catalogicsoftware.com/).
I have several years of experience in building software and
over that period, I have accumulated few personal preferences on the
way things should be done in writing code. I am primarily going to blog
about those preferences and can only hope that someone somewhere
would find them useful. Please feel free to contact me at “draghuram at
gmail dot com”. 

*Disclaimer: All the opinions expressed in this blog are mine and in no
way should they presumed to be endorsed by my current employer.*
