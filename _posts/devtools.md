Developers should build tools while working on their main job. It has
many advantages. 

- It gives you an opportunity to learn some new language or technology
  that you may not be using in their day to day work.
  
- Tools increase productivity in the long run not only for you but
  most probably for rest of the team as well.
  
- They increase the level of understanding of the underlying
  concepts. For example, if you are writing a log parser, you will
  have to thoroughly understand the format of messages in log
  files. During the process, you may discover if the logging in the
  product is inconsistent or how it can be improved.
  
- Finally, they are fun and allow you to be distracted from the main
  work. This is very important.
  
Tools need not be big. Usually, they are automation of what you
repeatedly do. Some of the tools I built:

- Parser for binary data on the wire.
- job log parser
- rim - wrapper for old vcs
- small shell scripts to do REST requests
- task manager
- stack trace compactor

In each, explain what prompted me to write the tool in the first place
and what benefits it bestowed.

## Conclusion

Coding is fun and developers should be curious to learn
continuously. On the contrary, doing monotonous tasks is boring.
writing tools is one great of way of solving both these problems while
at the same time, helping the productivity.
