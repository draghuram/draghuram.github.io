Over the course of last few months, I have been working on 
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) related projects and the first
result of that work is release of 
[KubeDR](https://github.com/catalogicsoftware/kubedr).

In a first, 
[Catalogic Software](https://catalogicsoftware.com/), where I work,
decided to release the project as open source. Like many developers, I
have used many open source projects and even released many of my own
tools and utilities on github. However, this was the first time I am
involved in the release of an open source project at this scale and I
must say it is very exciting. 

Here is a blog post I wrote at the time of
[KubeDR](https://github.com/catalogicsoftware/kubedr)'s release:
