Welcome! I have finally found time to set up a text-based blogging
system that would allow me to move away from 
[my current blog](https://techfortytwo.wordpress.com) hosted on
*Wordpress*. Writing posts in a browser has been feeling increasingly
archaic and I have been thinking of taking advantage of the excellent
blogging platform offered by [github](http://github.com) + 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for a long time. 

Over next few days and weeks, I will be porting posts from my old blog
to here. There aren't that many so hopefully I can do it quickly. 

Before I go, I should give a special call out to the very nice 
[Jekyll Docker image](https://github.com/jekyll/docker). I use this to view my
changes locally before pushing them to github. 

That is all for now. More later.
