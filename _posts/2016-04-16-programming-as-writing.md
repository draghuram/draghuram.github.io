Great care should be taken to make code readable. This is no different
from writing, say, prose. Similar principles apply. Use proper grammar
and punctuation in comments. Keep things simple. Pick proper
names. Keep the unit focused to a possibly a single
responsibility. Keep things small. 

In particular, understand that even a seemingly small careless mistake
affects entire program. Perhaps, that sentence in the Javadoc comment
is grammatically wrong but what does it matter? Code is still
correct. Right? Not really. A mistake like that gives the impression
that the code is not being maintained at the highest quality. 

The visual aspects of a program are important too. Too many blank
lines make an otherwise good program look ugly. Similarly, lack of
blank lines at some places makes it look cluttered. Proper indentation
is important as well. It is amazing how these two simple aspects -
indentation and proper placement of blank lines, can make a huge
difference when it comes to readability. 

In short, a program should be a pleasure to read just like a book is
expected to be.
